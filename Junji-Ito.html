                My most Favorite horror icon and Manga Writer/Artist.</p>
                Junji Ito has to be one of my most FAVORITE horror writers and artists, books such as Tomei, Remina, Spiral are iconic in the Manga
                community. He appeals to body horror and a bit of cosmic with his art. He makes enganging characters that are sometimes bad people
                themselves or completely innocent that are just victims of his horrofic creations.</p>
                Spiral has to be one of my most favorite books from him and iconic, to the right I have video essays talking about his works most 
                people consider well known. Back to spiral it's so enganging, horrofic and grotesque which is his appeal, the main character investigates
                strange activities and stories from people in the town she resides, each chapter becomes worse in events with the eventual turning of the town.</p>
                Typing this makes me feel like I'm not doing Ito justice in his work, which again why I'm glad I linked the videos on the right, I genuinely
                recommend people to read him and see his works, he's an incredible artist and person even who is very colorful from many interviews he's done
                and a book he released documenting his writing with his cats.</p>
                Overall one of my favorite ever artists and writer and hope to read more of his works, I own almost 10 books of his or more but still want a 
                bigger collection.
