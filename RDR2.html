                This game is one of my personal top favorite I've ever played and still play to this day on my PC.</p></br>
                Released in 2018 Red Dead Redemption II is a game that is set before the events of Red Dead Redemption I,
                you follow Arthur Morgan and the Van Der Linde Gang on the run from the law and enroaching civilized world 
                as the Old West, or what's left of it, is being taken by civilization.</p>
                I played this game on launch and was blown away by the detail in animations, art, scenery, gunplay, etc, 
                that was made over the span of 6ish years of development by over 1000 people at Rockstar Studios.</br>
                The open world is one of a kind with how "alive" it feels, meeting random strangers that either need your
                players help or a threat due to the nature of 1899 America in the West was so much fun. I was in 10th grade
                when this game and lost so much sleep and stayed up for nearly the whole weekend playing this game. Completing
                the story around 3 days after launch.</p>
                To the right of this you can see some links I've added the 1st being the teaser trailer we got in 2016 announcing 
                RDR2, the 2nd being the gameplay trailer and overview with how the game would work mechanically, the 3rd is a 
                playlist still updated from a YouTuber going into detail about secrets and connections still found today. Seeing this game
                being revealed over time, along with news and even leaks at times made me so excited to explore the world Rockstar
                created. Me with other people even feel nostalgia with how it's been 5 years since its release.</p>
                Overall a beautiful game that shows why Rockstar are a industry leader in open world games and storytelling, and why
                people's expectations for Grand Theft Auto VI are so high.
