                This is my personal best for last series.</p>
                Berserk is a manga series I've been into since around 2018 in High School, but didn't start reading until 2022 when I started college at UTRGV
                with the first deluxe edition. After reading the first book I can say without a doubt this is my most FAVORITE manga I will ever read in my life.
                You follow a main character named Guts who is a mercenary going after vessels of sorts for the Godhand, a mysterious group that is later revealed.
                What gets me in the series is the very dark and gritty nature of the manga, it deals with very heavy topics in a perfect manner such as abuse and much
                worse, the content is very mature but so enganging as you see the type of monsters Guts will fight, even with him admitting he's no better than some of
                him due to his poor upbringing and non-caring attitude for innocents.</p>
                In the later deluxe novels it's revealed Guts origin story and why he's after the Godhand, his group leader he looked up to named Griffith was presented 
                as noble and a good man, but in desperation wanted power with a King's daughter, this leads to his imprisonment and abuse by his captors, and in his very 
                desperate moment, uses a relic named the Behelit to trigger the eclipse and fulfill his idea of a kingdom. He causes his friends to be killed and Guts tries
                to save him but Griffith is gone, he's corrupted and is given a new body by the Godhand with him later committing vicious actions against Guts and Casca who
                is Guts love interest.</p>
                That was the general gist and an EARLY climax of the story but there's so much more which I won't spoil. Berserk is a gritty, well amazingly written story 
                following a grey moral protaganist that does eventually evolve in his arc. The art on each manga panel, the world, the villians, and Guts mission to kill the
                Godhand who are abhorrent in their treatment of disciples who fail them is supported, but the personal beef between Guts and Griffith is amazing, one of the two
                best arch enemies in fiction with how Griffith berates and downplays Guts due to his new abilities and views of the world after succumbing using the behelit.</p>
                I've linked some videos about the Anime and Original Anime that was adapted in the late 90s that go into detail, but I would recomment this for older people of course
                due to the content this manga has, as it's absolutely incredible, the creator sadly passed away but had someone he was training to finish his work and is currently doing so.
                Berserk is a one of a kind manga that will stand the test of time and millions of people love and has such a devoted community towards it and it's creator alone, I will
                personally always treasure this manga due to a personal connection I have with it and forever treasure the world and characters Kentaro Miura created.
