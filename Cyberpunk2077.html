                Cyberpunk 2077 once a controversial title on release due to issues is now among my favorite games.</p>
                I purchased this game around launch in December 2020 on my PC, after the first few hours the game seemed extremely 
                good but issues aroused such as the game missing MANY promised features and it being very broken and buggy even on 
                high end computers. I encountered broken AI, broken police, the armor system was horrid since it was randomized 
                so your character would have to wear high heels for better armor and mixed pants and shirts making it look very
                stupid looking to be honest. The game became controversial with it's released state and causing Sony to issue 
                refunds with no questions asked. Many videos and even video hour long essays going into the depth of the games 
                core issues.</p>
                I began playing the game recently again after the 2.0 updated fixed a majority of issues and the DLC Phantom Liberty 
                I purchased during a recent sale on Steam had it, I can say without a doubt as of 2024 that Cyperpunk 2077 is a MUCH 
                better, rebalanced and although a little glitchy very good game, Night City is extremely fun to explore, doing jobs
                for the people you have on contacts learning more about the criminal element is satisfying. The characters are amazingly
                designed and engaging. The 2.0 update updated the skill tree, added more from the Anime that released on Netflix and 
                just made the game a much better product. The story although I haven't beat I'm excited to see where the main character
                named V ends up.</p>
                Phantom Liberty deserves it very own spotlight, this DLC is INCREDIBLE, opening a part of the map up and utilizing the power
                of the next generation consoles and PC shows the games original potential, the enemies are so much fun to fight, the story is 
                just downright incredible with the quests I've done so far, a $20 purchase I made has 30+ hours of content ALONG the original game.
                The new clothes, jobs, cars, characters are mind blowing, it's so enganging and deserves to be played along the main game.
                Personally it brings the game up so much for me and I was excited to install the DLC add-on to add more to my world.
