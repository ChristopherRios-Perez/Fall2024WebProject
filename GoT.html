                A revered book series along with the show, Game of Thrones is a series I hope is one day ended on a proper note.</p>
                I got into Game of Thrones around the release of House of the Dragon Season 1, the world building is very in-depth for 
                a HBO show and Fantasy at that. This year I decided to watch Game of Thrones in full and was blown away by the series.
                Season 1-4 are absolute incredible TV and I see why it won so many awards with dinklage as well for his character Tyrion.</p>
                Game of Thrones is a book about politics and families fighting over the Iron Throne, to rule over the 7 kingdoms in Westeros,
                it follows multiple POV's of characters like in the book exploring characters depth, morals and showing even heroes are 
                grey in their path, or not pure as traditionally we believe them too. With a show that has a light bit of Magic, the Night King 
                who resides north of the Wall with an army of undead and a dynasty of a family that wants their kingdom back, the most interesting
                part of the show is the characters we see thrown in unpredictable scenarios. It doesn't hold back on killing your favorites and 
                allowing the villians to relish in their victory only to be killed as well, or not sometimes. We see characters such as Tyrion and 
                Jaimie evolve into different versions of themselves. Some characters become better or more hero like, and some such as Cersei become
                much more cruel, evil, and tyrants in the name of their family.</p>
                The show is regarded highly but sadly past season 4 it drops in quality. It disconnects from the books which the previous seasons
                followed heavily the show ended on a bad note that a majority of people agree on, along with the very poor reviews. The books remain
                engaging but we have not had a sequel to them since 2011, with Winds of Winter and a Dream of Spring being the last remaining left to
                finish the A Song of Ice and Fire franchise conclusively. I love the books with Book 1 I've read and need the rest, but the show left
                a sour taste for something that was so revered and loved and hope if George R.R Martin does intend to finish them, make the fans happy.
