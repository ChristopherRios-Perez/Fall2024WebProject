                Hello! My name is Christopher Rios-Perez, this page is about me in general.</p>
                I'm a current student at South Texas College pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer and Information Technology.
                I'm hoping once I'm done with my classes and school in the near-future to become a Network Administrator.</p>
                I grew up in Edinburg Texas, I'm 21 years old as of 2024 and have about a year left of school, I've always been into Computers
                since around middle school and became more interested in the technical stuff around High School. I did attend UTRGV for Computer
                Science but transferred to STC to pursue their Bachelor in CITP as I favor a career in that compared to CS, also due to the difficulty
                of CS it tethered me more to CITP. </br></p>
                I have a gaming PC as well and it's my main machine for EVERYTHING, as I run Minecraft servers with Mods and different launcher variations,
                do homework and some other side projects as well as game of course. My gaming PC contains a 4080 Super as a GPU, a 7800X3D for CPU, 64gb of
                6200mhz ram, 1tb and 4tb of GEN4 NVME4 storage for games, programs, and servers.</br></p>
                I hope this entire website I've created helps delve into some of my interests and the sort of stuff I'm into generally. Web programming is 
                a small interest I have as it's cool, I do hope to create more personal non related projects and might create one in the future or during Christmas
                breaking using my Resume for future job prospects.</p>
                Thank you for viewing this and reading this section of the About Me!
