                    Batman Arkham City is an action-adventure game, one of my top childhood ones, it expands so much more on the Arkham-Verse and gameplay.

                    We fill the suit of Bruce Wayne who is Batman after being thrown into the Mega Prison known as Arkham City, with the goal of shutting down a master plan that intends to expose Batman's Secret.
                    Playing as Batman means you use a wide range of gadgets, investigative technologies and meet a wide range of his villains gallery, which include Two-Face, Catwoman, Harley Quinn, The Joker,
                    Penguin along with others that appear as a surprise throughout the story. Batman works towards unraveling the plot behind the City with twists and turns at every corner.

                    This game originally released on October 11, 2011 on PC, Xbox 360, and Playstation 3 systems with Kevin Conroy as Batman, Mark Hamill returning as the Joker and Troy Baker as Two-Face.
                    I originally bought my Xbox 360 copy in late 2012 and became obsessed with the game, its sprawling city at the time and upgraded combat and traversal compared to Arkham Asylum's. Being 9-10 years old playing this game was an amazing experience,
                    it was a pure Batman experience along with an incredible story that I'll always remember even when I do a replay to this day. <a href="https://arkhamcity.fandom.com/wiki/Arkham_City" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arkham City</a> is 
                    a dense old part of Gotham City that is overrun by criminals even before the prison was built, with a history that unravels that reveals the true nature of the City.
